# Minicat

# Introduction
In order to keep practicing and learning Rust, I have decided to try to implement other Command Line Programs. This time I will try to implement *cat*.

First let's try to get the very basic functionality, or at least the most commonly known functionality (what everybody thinks cat does) working, which is pretty much just printing a file's contents on the screen. Then let's see what happens after that.

Managed to implement -n and -E (-n and -e in my program). That made me refactor some parts of how I originally implemented the "normal behavior". But everything seems to be working correctly.
I think I'll stop this project here.
